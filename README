--- COMPILE CLIENT AND SERVER ---
gcc udp_client.c -o client
gcc udp_server.c -o server

--- RUN CLIENT AND SERVER ---
./server [port_number]
./client [ip_address] [port_number]

--- NOTES ---
BUFSIZE must be > sizeof(Header)
Run server first?
Port number > 5000
When running both the client and the server on the same machine (aka testing locally)
    use “localhost” or "127.0.0.1" in place of the IP address.
